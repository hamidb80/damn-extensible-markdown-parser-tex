# Damn Extensible Markdown Parser

## Motivation

we're in 2025, age of AI, 
and still there is not a single simple markdown *extensible* 
markdown parser without quirks 
in Python or JS.

I hate these *noobie* developers that 
would say "this requires major blah blah" 
for *every single issue* instead of actually doing
the **right work**. 

this is an attempt to end my struggles and headaches, 
IN JUST A SINGLE DAMN FILE.

## a message to those noobie devs

please read my code and learn. 
you don't need 50+ classes and 10+ interfaces or 5+ dependencies to parse a markdown!
you just need to know how to program, 
do not over-complicated everything.

## Usage
